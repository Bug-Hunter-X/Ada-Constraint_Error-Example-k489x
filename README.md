# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception.  Ada's strong type system and range checks are designed to prevent many common programming errors, but they can also lead to exceptions if not properly handled.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that intentionally causes a `Constraint_Error`. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to properly handle the exception.

This is a great way to highlight Ada's error handling capabilities and the importance of understanding type constraints.
